# Fraud_detection


This project focuses on building and evaluating a fraud detection system using Python and Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, followed by data visualization in Power BI.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, outliers, and performed feature scaling.
Applied encoding techniques for categorical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed patterns and trends using visualizations.
Identified key features contributing to fraudulent activities.
Machine Learning Models:

Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms.
Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.
Generated a Confusion Matrix to analyze classification performance.
Visualization with Power BI:

Loaded the processed dataset into Power BI.
Created interactive dashboards and visuals showcasing insights into fraud detection.
Tools and Technologies
Python: Data preprocessing, EDA, and model implementation.
Jupyter Notebook: Notebook environment for step-by-step development.
Power BI: Visualization and dashboard creation.
Outcomes
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for detecting fraudulent activities, from data preparation and modeling to insightful visualizations.
